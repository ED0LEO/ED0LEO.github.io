# ED0LEO's Laboratory

A collection of weird tools. Mostly useful only for me, everythig is designed according to my needs.

## Featured Tools

### Nexus Search
Nicer interface for google programmable search engine with my filters. Filters some media goliaths by default, has youtube embeed preview, AntiRot and DOCS filters, and golden era time sorting (earlier than 2018 or GE2 for 2011-2018).

### Hacker News Reader
Alternative front end for hacker news, filter undesirable words or create custom topics.

### Dining Philosophers
Visualizer with logs (small timing is not perfect).

### Python Workspace
A browser-based python environment (primitive).

### Focus Tracker
Life tracker for improved focus. Has motivational pages.

### Desktop Environments
Science-themed desktop simulators. 

### RSS Reader
Rss reader (not sure if works, abandoned for now).
